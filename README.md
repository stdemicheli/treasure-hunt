# treasure-hunt

Treasure hunt is a game that requires the user to explore the entire map and then collect treasures across the map. The app was implemented using a depth-first search algorithm to build a graph that constitues the entire map. It then uses breadth-first search in order to travel to a specific point and then collect treasures along the way.
